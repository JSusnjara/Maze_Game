# Maze_Game
A simple C++ 2D maze game. The goal is to find the shortest route towards the exit.

## Description
Every maze is generated randomly, and checked whether it's solvable. Changing level of difficulty changes the size of the maze.

Game interface is accomplished by just printing empty text in different colors of background.
